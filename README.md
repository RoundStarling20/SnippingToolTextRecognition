# SnippingToolTextRecognition
A snipping tool that copies text in the image to the clipboard.

Original snipping-tool application made by [harupy](https://github.com/harupy/snipping-tool)

I saw the need to be able to copy text like code or windows errors from their respective non-copyable window and be able to paste them wherever I wanted.
